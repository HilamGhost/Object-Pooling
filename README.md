# 🏊‍♂️ Object Pooling for People Who Are Tired of Instantiate() Spam

# 

# Welcome to the most basic but beautiful Object Pool™ in Unity.

# This class was created for those who:

# 

# Have trust issues with Instantiate() and Destroy() eating their framerate.

# 

# Hate garbage collector surprises more than surprise quizzes.

# 

# Want their bullets, particles, or enemies to recycle like eco-friendly game developers.

# 

# 📦 What Does It Do?

# 

# Imagine a magical factory that builds 10 objects, then says:

# 

# “No more new toys until you return the old ones!”

# 

# That’s it.

# 

# It makes a bunch of objects at the start.

# 

# Keeps them in a queue like people waiting for döner.

# 

# Hands them out when you ask for one.

# 

# Takes them back when you’re done.

# 

# No more crying because you spawned 10,000 bullets in 3 seconds.

# 

# 🚀 How To Use

# // Prefab must be a MonoBehaviour + IPoolObject (don’t ask, just trust).

# var myPool = new ObjectPool<Bullet>(bulletPrefab, 20, someParentTransform);

# 

# // Spawn something

# Bullet b = myPool.Spawn();

# 

# // When you’re done blasting aliens:

# myPool.ReturnToPool(b);

# 

# // Or just rage quit:

# myPool.DespawnAllObjects();

# 

# 🧠 FAQ

# 

# Q: Why do I need this?

# A: Because Instantiate() and Destroy() are basically Unity’s version of “hey, let’s make your game stutter for fun.”

# 

# Q: What happens if I spawn too many?

# A: Don’t worry. The pool will yeet the oldest object back into the pool like an angry bouncer at a nightclub.

# 

# Q: Is this production-ready?

# A: Absolutely.

# Is it enterprise-ready?

# …No. Please don’t give this to NASA.

# 

# 🌱 Eco-friendly Development

# 

# This pool encourages recycling. You’re not wasting objects, you’re saving FPS. 🌍✨
